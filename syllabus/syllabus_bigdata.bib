   abstract = {Leadership positions in the U.S. are disproportionately held by graduates of a few highly selective private colleges. Could such colleges-which currently have many more students from high-income families than low-income families-increase the socioeconomic diversity of America's leaders by changing their admissions policies? We use anonymized admissions data from several private and public colleges linked to income tax records and SAT and ACT test scores to study this question. Children from families in the top 1% are more than twice as likely to attend an Ivy-Plus college (Ivy League, Stanford, MIT, Duke, and Chicago) as those from middle-class families with comparable SAT/ACT scores. Two-thirds of this gap is due to higher admissions rates for students with comparable test scores from high-income families; the remaining third is due to differences in rates of application and matriculation. In contrast, children from high-income families have no admissions advantage at flagship public colleges. The high-income admissions advantage at private colleges is driven by three factors: (1) preferences for children of alumni, (2) weight placed on non-academic credentials, which tend to be stronger for students applying from private high schools that have affluent student bodies, and (3) recruitment of athletes, who tend to come from higher-income families. Using a new research design that isolates idiosyncratic variation in admissions decisions for waitlisted applicants, we show that attending an Ivy-Plus college instead of the average highly selective public flagship institution increases students' chances of reaching the top 1% of the earnings distribution by 60%, nearly doubles their chances of attending an elite graduate school, and triples their chances of working at a prestigious firm. Ivy-Plus colleges have much smaller causal effects on average earnings, reconciling our findings with prior work that found smaller causal effects using variation in matriculation decisions conditional on admission. Adjusting for the value-added of the colleges that students attend, the three key factors that give children from high-income families an admissions advantage are uncorrelated or negatively correlated with post-college outcomes, whereas SAT/ACT scores and academic credentials are highly predictive of post-college success. We conclude that highly selective private colleges currently amplify the persistence of privilege across generations, but could diversify the socioeconomic backgrounds of America's leaders by changing their admissions practices.},

This same maximum induces a nonlinear and nonmonotonic relationship between grade enrollment and class size in Israeli public schools today. Maimonides' rule of 40 is used here to construct instrumental variables estimates of effects of class size on test scores. The resulting identification strategy can be viewed as an application of Donald Campbell's regression-discontinuity design to the class-size question. The estimates show that reducing class size induces a significant and substantial increase in test scores for fourth and fifth graders, although not for third graders.},

   abstract = {In Project STAR, 11,571 students in Tennessee and their teachers were randomly assigned to classrooms within their schools from kindergarten to third grade. This article evaluates the long-term impacts of STAR by linking the experimental data to administrative records. We first demonstrate that kindergarten test scores are highly correlated with outcomes such as earnings at age 27, college attendance, home ownership, and retirement savings. We then document four sets of experimental impacts. First, students in small classes are significantly more likely to attend college and exhibit improvements on other outcomes. Class size does not have a significant effect on earnings at age 27, but this effect is imprecisely estimated. Second, students who had a more experienced teacher in kindergarten have higher earnings. Third, an analysis of variance reveals significant classroom effects on earnings. Students who were randomly assigned to higher quality classrooms in grades K-3-as measured by classmates' end-of-class test scores-have higher earnings, college attendance rates, and other outcomes. Finally, the effects of class quality fade out on test scores in later grades, but gains in noncognitive measures persist. © The Author(s) 2011.

We give a general impossibility result showing that a formalization of Dalenius' goal along the lines of semantic security cannot be achieved. Contrary to intuition, a variant of the result threatens the privacy even of someone not in the database. This state of affairs suggests a new measure, differential privacy, which, intuitively, captures the increased risk to one's privacy incurred by participating in a database. The techniques developed in a sequence of papers [8, 13, 3], culminating in those described in [12], can achieve any desired level of privacy under this measure. In many cases, extremely accurate information about the database can be provided while simultaneously ensuring very high levels of privacy. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2006.},

Optimal choice weighs the demand for accurate statistics against the demand for privacy. Examples from US statistical programs show how our framework can guide decision-making. Further progress requires a better understanding of willingness-to-pay for privacy and statistical accuracy. (JEL C38, C81, D83)},

   abstract = {Can machine learning improve human decision making? Bail decisions provide a good test case. Millions of times each year, judges make jail-or-release decisions that hinge on a prediction of what a defendant would do if released. The concreteness of the prediction task combined with the volume of data available makes this a promising machine-learning application. Yet comparing the algorithm to judges proves complicated. First, the available data are generated by prior judge decisions. We only observe crime outcomes for released defendants, not for those judges detained. This makes it hard to evaluate counterfactual decision rules based on algorithmic predictions. Second, judges may have a broader set of preferences than the variable the algorithm predicts; for instance, judges may care specifically about violent crimes or about racial inequities. We deal with these problems using different econometric strategies, such as quasi-random assignment of cases to judges. Even accounting for these concerns, our results suggest potentially large welfare gains: one policy simulation shows crime reductions up to 24.7% with no change in jailing rates, or jailing rate reductions up to 41.9% with no increase in crime rates. Moreover, all categories of crime, including violent crimes, show reductions; these gains can be achieved while simultaneously reducing racial disparities. These results suggest that while machine learning can be valuable, realizing this value requires integrating these tools into an economic framework: being clear about the link between predictions and decisions; specifying the scope of payoff functions; and constructing unbiased decision counterfactuals.},

First, we characterize the joint distribution of parent and child income at the national level. The conditional expectation of child income given parent income is linear in percentile ranks. On average, a 10 percentile increase in parent income is associated with a 3.4 percentile increase in a child's income. Second, intergenerational mobility varies substantially across areas within the United States. For example, the probability that a child reaches the top quintile of the national income distribution starting from a family in the bottom quintile is 4.4% in Charlotte but 12.9% in San Jose. Third, we explore the factors correlated with upward mobility. High mobility areas have (i) less residential segregation, (ii) less income inequality, (iii) better primary schools, (iv) greater social capital, and (v) greater family stability. Although our descriptive analysis does not identify the causal mechanisms that determine upward mobility, the publicly available statistics on interge-nerational mobility developed here can facilitate research on such mechanisms.},

We distinguish the causal effects of neighborhoods from confounding factors by comparing the outcomes of siblings within families, studying moves triggered by displacement shocks, and exploiting sharp variation in predicted place effects across birth cohorts, genders, and quantiles to implement overidentification tests. The findings show that neighborhoods affect intergenerational mobility primarily through childhood exposure, helping reconcile conflicting results in the prior literature.},

Some of the core commitments of existing research ethics regulations, such as the distinction between research and practice, cannot be cleanly exported from biomedical research to data science research. Such discontinuities have led some data science practitioners and researchers to move toward rejecting ethics regulations outright. These shifts occur at the same time as a proposal for major revisions to the Common Rule—the primary regulation governing human-subjects research in the USA—is under consideration for the first time in decades. We contextualize these revisions in long-running complaints about regulation of social science research and argue data science should be understood as continuous with social sciences in this regard. The proposed regulations are more flexible and scalable to the methods of non-biomedical research, yet problematically largely exclude data science methods from human-subjects regulation, particularly uses of public datasets. The ethical frameworks for Big Data research are highly contested and in flux, and the potential harms of data science research are unpredictable. We examine several contentious cases of research harms in data science, including the 2014 Facebook emotional contagion study and the 2016 use of geographical data techniques to identify the pseudonymous artist Banksy. To address disputes about application of human-subjects research ethics in data science, critical data studies should offer a historically nuanced theory of “data subjectivity” responsive to the epistemic methods, harms and benefits of data science and commerce.},

   abstract = {Social capital—the strength of an individual’s social network and community—has been identified as a potential determinant of outcomes ranging from education to health1–8. However, efforts to understand what types of social capital matter for these outcomes have been hindered by a lack of social network data. Here, in the first of a pair of papers9, we use data on 21 billion friendships from Facebook to study social capital. We measure and analyse three types of social capital by ZIP (postal) code in the United States: (1) connectedness between different types of people, such as those with low versus high socioeconomic status (SES); (2) social cohesion, such as the extent of cliques in friendship networks; and (3) civic engagement, such as rates of volunteering. These measures vary substantially across areas, but are not highly correlated with each other. We demonstrate the importance of distinguishing these forms of social capital by analysing their associations with economic mobility across areas. The share of high-SES friends among individuals with low SES—which we term economic connectedness—is among the strongest predictors of upward income mobility identified to date10,11. Other social capital measures are not strongly associated with economic mobility. If children with low-SES parents were to grow up in counties with economic connectedness comparable to that of the average child with high-SES parents, their incomes in adulthood would increase by 20% on average. Differences in economic connectedness can explain well-known relationships between upward income mobility and racial segregation, poverty rates, and inequality12–14. To support further research and policy interventions, we publicly release privacy-protected statistics on social capital by ZIP code at https://www.socialcapital.org . Analyses of data on 21 billion friendships from Facebook in the United States reveal associations between social capital and economic mobility.},

   abstract = {We construct a publicly available atlas of children's outcomes in adulthood by Census tract using anonymized longitudinal data covering nearly the entire U.S. population. For each tract, we estimate children's earnings distributions, incarceration rates, and other outcomes in adulthood by parental income, race, and gender. These estimates allow us to trace the roots of outcomes such as poverty and incarceration back to the neighborhoods in which children grew up. We find that children's outcomes vary sharply across nearby areas: for children of parents at the 25th percentile of the income distribution, the standard deviation of mean household income at age 35 is $5,000 across tracts within counties. We illustrate how these tract-level data can provide insight into how neighborhoods shape the development of human capital and support local economic policy using two applications. First, the estimates permit precise targeting of policies to improve economic opportunity by uncovering specific neighborhoods where certain subgroups of children grow up to have poor outcomes. Neighborhoods matter at a very granular level: conditional on characteristics such as poverty rates in a child's own Census tract, characteristics of tracts that are one mile away have little predictive power for a child's outcomes. Our historical estimates are informative predictors of outcomes even for children growing up today because neighborhood conditions are relatively stable over time. Second, we show that the observational estimates are highly predictive of neighborhoods' causal effects, based on a comparison to data from the Moving to Opportunity experiment and a quasi-experimental research design analyzing movers' outcomes. We then identify high-opportunity neighborhoods that are affordable to low-income families, providing an input into the design of affordable housing policies. Our measures of children's long-term outcomes are only weakly correlated with traditional proxies for local economic success such as rates of job growth, showing that the conditions that create greater upward mobility are not necessarily the same as those that lead to productive labor markets.},

High income households are also 13 percentage points more likely to have a crowdfunding campaign at all. The regressive nature of disaster crowdfunding is not due to less severe losses by financially vulnerable consumers, nor is it fully explained by the degree of online campaign sharing.

We explore this by examining labour supply choices and earnings among more than a million rideshare drivers on Uber in the U.S. We document a roughly 7% gender earnings gap amongst drivers. We show that this gap can be entirely attributed to three factors: Experience on the platform (learning-by-doing), preferences and constraints over where to work (driven largely by where drivers live and, to a lesser extent, safety), and preferences for driving speed. We do not find that men and women are differentially affected by a taste for specific hours, a return to within-week work intensity, or customer discrimination. Our results suggest that, in a "gig"economy setting with no gender discrimination and highly flexible labour markets, women's relatively high opportunity cost of non-paid-work time and gender-based differences in preferences and constraints can sustain a gender pay gap.},

   abstract = {Recent changes in labor arrangements have increased interest in estimating and understanding the value of job flexibility. We leverage a large natural field experiment at Uber to create exogenous variation in expected market wages across individuals and over time. Combining this experiment with high frequency panel data on wages and individual work decisions, we document how labor supply responds to exogenous changes in expected market wages in a setting with virtually no restrictions on driver labor allocation. We find that there is i) systematic heterogeneity in labor supply responses both across drivers and within a driver over time, ii) significant fixed costs of beginning a shift, and iii) high rider demand when it is costly for drivers to work. These three findings motivate a model of labor supply with heterogenous preferences over work schedules, adjustment costs, and statistical dependence between market wages and the costs of driving. We recover the labor supply elasticities and reservation wages of this dynamic labor supply model via a combination of experimental estimates and other data moments. We then perform counterfactual analyses that allow us to examine how preference heterogeneity and adjustment costs influence the responses of workers' to wage incentives as well as infer drivers' willingness to pay for the ability to customize and adjust their work schedule. We also show that a static approach to the driver's dynamic problem delivers materially different estimates of workers' labor supply elasticities and their value of job flexibility.},

Combining experimental and natural variation in the data, we are able to establish tipping facts as well as provide insights into the underlying motives for tipping. Interestingly, even though tips are made privately, and without external social benefits or pressure, more than 15% of trips are tipped. Yet, nearly 60% of people never tip, and only 1% of people always tip. Overall, the demand-side explains much more of the observed tipping variation than the supply-side.},

@article{athey2017appliedeconometrics,
   abstract = {T he gold standard for drawing inferences about the effect of a policy is a randomized controlled experiment. However, in many cases, experiments remain difficult or impossible to implement, for financial, political, or ethical reasons, or because the population of interest is too small. For example, it would be unethical to prevent potential students from attending college in order to study the causal effect of college attendance on labor market experiences, and politically infea-sible to study the effect of the minimum wage by randomly assigning minimum wage policies to states. Thus, a large share of the empirical work in economics about policy questions relies on observational data-that is, data where policies were determined in a way other than through random assignment. Drawing inferences about the causal effect of a policy from observational data is quite challenging. To understand the challenges, consider the example of the minimum wage. A naive analysis of the observational data might compare the average employment level of states with a high minimum wage to that of states with a low minimum wage. This difference is surely not a credible estimate of the causal effect of a higher minimum wage, defined as the change in employment that would occur if the low-wage states raised their minimum wage. For example, it might be the case that states with higher costs of living, as well as more price-insensitive consumers, choose higher levels of the minimum wage},

In contrast, crowdsourced data from online platforms such as Yelp are often contemporaneous and geographically finer than official government statistics. In this paper, we present evidence that Yelp data can complement government surveys by measuring economic activity in close to real time, at a granular level, and at almost any geographic scale. Changes in the number of businesses and restaurants reviewed on Yelp can predict changes in the number of overall establishments and restaurants in County Business Patterns. An algorithm using contemporaneous and lagged Yelp data can explain 29.2 percent of the residual variance after accounting for lagged CBP data, in a testing sample not used to generate the algorithm.

   abstract = {Leadership positions in the U.S. are disproportionately held by graduates of a few highly selective private colleges. Could such colleges-which currently have many more students from high-income families than low-income families-increase the socioeconomic diversity of America's leaders by changing their admissions policies? We use anonymized admissions data from several private and public colleges linked to income tax records and SAT and ACT test scores to study this question. Children from families in the top 1% are more than twice as likely to attend an Ivy-Plus college (Ivy League, Stanford, MIT, Duke, and Chicago) as those from middle-class families with comparable SAT/ACT scores. Two-thirds of this gap is due to higher admissions rates for students with comparable test scores from high-income families; the remaining third is due to differences in rates of application and matriculation. In contrast, children from high-income families have no admissions advantage at flagship public colleges. The high-income admissions advantage at private colleges is driven by three factors: (1) preferences for children of alumni, (2) weight placed on non-academic credentials, which tend to be stronger for students applying from private high schools that have affluent student bodies, and (3) recruitment of athletes, who tend to come from higher-income families. Using a new research design that isolates idiosyncratic variation in admissions decisions for waitlisted applicants, we show that attending an Ivy-Plus college instead of the average highly selective public flagship institution increases students' chances of reaching the top 1% of the earnings distribution by 60%, nearly doubles their chances of attending an elite graduate school, and triples their chances of working at a prestigious firm. Ivy-Plus colleges have much smaller causal effects on average earnings, reconciling our findings with prior work that found smaller causal effects using variation in matriculation decisions conditional on admission. Adjusting for the value-added of the colleges that students attend, the three key factors that give children from high-income families an admissions advantage are uncorrelated or negatively correlated with post-college outcomes, whereas SAT/ACT scores and academic credentials are highly predictive of post-college success. We conclude that highly selective private colleges currently amplify the persistence of privilege across generations, but could diversify the socioeconomic backgrounds of America's leaders by changing their admissions practices.},

@article{einav2014ageofbigdata,
   abstract = {The quality and quantity of data on economic activity are expanding rapidly. Empirical research increasingly relies on newly available large-scale administrative data or private sector data that often is obtained through collaboration with private firms. Here we highlight some challenges in accessing and using these new data. We also discuss how new data sets may change the statistical methods used by economists and the types of questions posed in empirical research. T he expansion of data being collected on social and economic activity is likely to have profound effects on economic research. In this Review, we describe how newly available public and private sector data sets are being employed in economics. We also discuss how statistical methods in economics may adapt to take advantage of large-scale granu-lar data, as well as some of the challenges and opportunities for future empirical research. After providing some brief background in the next section, we divide the Review into three parts. We first discuss the shift from relatively small-sample government surveys to administrative data with universal or near-universal population coverage. These data have been used in Europe for some time but are just starting to be explored in the United States. We explain the transformative power of these data to shed light on variation across subpopulations, construct consistent long-run statistical indices, generate new quasi-experimental research designs, and track diverse outcomes from natural and controlled experiments. The second part of the Review describes the marked expansion of private sector data on economic activity. We outline the potential of these data in creating aggregate economic statistics and some nascent attempts to do this. We then discuss the rise of collaborations between academics and data-rich companies. These relationships have some trade-offs in terms of maintaining data confidentiality and working with samples that have been collected for business rather than research purposes. But as we illustrate with examples from recent work, they also provide researchers with a look inside the "black box" of firms and markets and create new opportunities to conduct and evaluate randomized experiments. The third part of this Review addresses statistical methods and the role of economic theory in the analysis of large-scale data sets. Today, economists routinely analyze large data sets with the same econometric methods used 15 or 20 years ago. We contrast these methods to some of the newer data mining approaches that have become popular in statistics and computer science. Economists, who tend to place a high premium on statistical inference and the identification of causal effects, have been skeptical about these methods, which put more emphasis on predic-tive fit and handling model uncertainty and on identifying low-dimensional structure in high-dimensional data. We argue that there are considerable gains from trade. We also stress the usefulness of economic theory in helping to organize complex and unstructured data. We conclude by discussing a few challenges in making use of new data opportunities, in particular the need to incorporate data management skills into economics training, and the difficulties of data access and research transparency in the presence of privacy and confidentiality concerns. The rise of empirical economics Hamermesh (1) recently reviewed publications from 1963 to 2011 in top economics journals. Until the mid-1980s, the majority of papers were theoretical; the remainder relied mainly on "ready-made" data from government statistics or surveys. Since then, the share of empirical papers in top journals has climbed to more than 70%, and a substantial majority of these papers use data that have been assembled or obtained by the authors or generated through a controlled experiment. This shift mirrors the expansion of available data. Even 15 or 20 years ago, interesting and unstudied data sets were a scarce resource. Gathering data on a specific industry could involve hunting through the library or manually extracting statistics from trade publications. Collaborations with companies were unusual, as were experiments , both in laboratory settings and in the field. Nowadays the situation is very different along all of these dimensions. Apart from simply having more observations and more recorded data in each observation, several features differentiate modern data sets from many used in earlier research. The first feature is that data are now often available in real time. Government surveys and statistics are released with a lag of months or years. Of course, many research questions are naturally retrospective, and it is more important for data to be detailed and accurate rather than available immediately. However, administrative and private data that are continuously updated have great value for helping to guide economic policy. Below, we discuss some early attempts to use Internet data to make real-time forecasts of inflation, retail sales, and labor market activity and to create new tracking measures of the economy. The second feature is that data are available on previously unmeasured activities. Much of the data now being recorded is on activities that were previously difficult to quantify: personal communications, social networks, search and information gathering, and geolocation data. These data may open the door to studying issues that economists have long viewed as important but did not have good ways to study empirically, such as the role of social connections and geographic proximity in shaping preferences, the transmission of information, consumer purchasing behavior, productivity, and job search. Finally, data come with less structure. Economists are used to working with "rectangular" data, with N observations and K << N variables per observation and a relatively simple dependence structure between the observations. New data sets often have higher dimensionality and less-clear structure. For example, Internet browsing histories contain a great deal of information about a person's interests and beliefs and how they evolve over time. But how can one extract this infor-mation? The data record a sequence of events that can be organized in an enormous number of ways, which may or may not be clearly linked and from which an almost unlimited number of variables can be created. Figuring out how to organize and reduce the dimensionality of large-scale, unstructured data is becoming a crucial challenge in empirical economic research. Public sector data: Administrative records In the course of administering the tax system, social programs, and regulation, the federal government collects highly detailed data on individuals and corporations. The same is true of state and local governments, albeit with less uniformity , in areas such as education, social insurance, and local government spending. As electronic versions of these data become available, they increasingly are the resource of choice for economists who work in fields such as labor economics, public finance, health, and education. Administrative data offer several advantages over traditional survey data. Workhorse surveys-such as the Survey of Consumer Finances, the Current Population Survey, the Survey of Income and Program Participation, and the Panel Study on Income Dynamics-can suffer from substantial missing data issues, and the sample size may be limited in ways that preclude natural quasi-experimental research designs (2). The rich microlevel administrative data sets maintained by, among others, the Social Security Administration , the Internal Revenue Service, and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid, often have},

However, big data will not solve large urban social science questions on its own. Big urban data has the most value for the study of cities when it allows measurement of the previously opaque, or when it can be coupled with exogenous shocks to people or place. We describe a number of new urban data sources and illustrate how they can be used to improve the study and function of cities. We first show how Google Street View images can be used to predict income in New York City, suggesting that similar imagery data can be used to map wealth and poverty in previously unmeasured areas of the developing world. We then discuss how survey techniques can be improved to better measure willingness to pay for urban amenities. Finally, we explain how Internet data is being used to improve the quality of city services. (JEL R1, C8, C18).},
