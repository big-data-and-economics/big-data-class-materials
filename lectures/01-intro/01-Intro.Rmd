# Why this course?

Fill in the gaps left by traditional econometrics and methods classes.

- Practical skills that tools that will benefit your thesis and future career.
- Neglected skills like how to actually find datasets in the wild and clean them.
- Apply skills to analyze empirical questions on economic and social problems. 

Data science skills are largely distinct from (and complementary to) the core 'metrics familiar to economists.

- Acquiring data; scraping; maintaining databases; etc. 
- Data viz, cleaning and wrangling; programming; cloud computation; relational databases; machine learning; etc.

# Caveat

- This course will be **_hard._** You will need to:
  - Teach yourself new skills I cannot cover in 12 weeks
  - Be entrepreneurial: If you find a better way to do something, do (and share) it!
  - Be patient: You will encounter bugs and errors, and you will need to learn how to fix them

- This course will also be **_rewarding_**
  - You can avoid the mistakes you make here on your thesis and in your career
  - You will learn skills that employers, pre-doc programs, and grad schools want
  - You will learn how to be a better researcher and citizen
    - Seriously, a little data science goes a long way in helping you see through BS

# Tips for coding fruitfully

You're gonna write a lot of code for this class, which means you're gonna troubleshoot a lot of bugs.

- Some of these will be bugs of your own making, some will be bugs of open source R tools

1. Try to describe in plain words/simple pictures what you want code to do before you write it
  - Read in a CSV file with variables for annual population at the county level and calculate the change in population from the previous year

2. Break this description into smaller steps (1: Read in data, 2: Drop rows with NA County, etc.)

3. Write code "modularly" (in pieces) to do each step, then you can troubleshoot modularly

4. The `help` documentation for R functions is the best place to start for troubleshooting

5. Google is your dictionary, AI is your weird friend who knows a lot of words but sometimes uses them wrong<sup>1</sup>
  - Be precise in your Google searches and ChatGPT instructions

  - I encourage you to use Generative AI ([ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) and [GitHub CoPilot](https://github.com/features/copilot)) to help learn R and Git

6. If you're stuck, ask for help from me and classmates on GitHub Discussions/Issues
  - Write a minimally reproducible example of the bug

<sup>1</sup> GitHub CoPilot (ChatGPT's cousin) wrote that sentence fragment!

# What is Data Science?

# What is Data Science?

- .hi[Data science (DS):] The scientific discipline that deals with transforming data into useful information ("insights") using a variety of stats/ML techniques

    - Facebook: Collects data on search history, friendship links, site clicks, occupation, etc.

    - Chetty et al. (2022) used FB data to estimate users' SES and social network ([Social Capital Atlas](https://www.socialcapital.org/))

- The rise of data science has come because of the so-called "Big" Data revolution

    - The rise of the internet in the late-1990s and 2000s $\Rightarrow \,\uparrow$ opportunities for companies and governments to collect data on consumers & citizens

    - Spread of mobile devices & social media from late 2000s until now generated even more data
    
#### Pillars of data science

- Programming (automation of data collection, manipulation, cleaning, visualization, and modeling)

- Visualization & exploration

- Causal inference (to be able to make a policy prescription)

- Machine learning (to select models, compress data, predict outcomes)

...Assuming one has the appropriate foundation of basic calculus and statistics

# Types of data

1. "Long" data (a.k.a. "Big-N" data because $N$ very, very large [and may not all fit onto a single hard drive!], government tax records, Medicare claims data, etc.)

2. "Wide" data (a.k.a. "Big-K" data because $K>N$, customer data sets where each click is a variable)

3. "Wild" data (unstructured; happenstance; collected without a particular intention; e.g. twitter, contrast with Census surveys)

4. "Big Data" is a catch-all for any combination of the above data types that is hard to analyze with classical methods like OLS regression
  - Too many variables
  - Too many observations
  - Needs special wrangling or analysis

---
# Long data
```{r img_long, echo=F, out.width="90%"}
knitr::include_graphics('pics/longdata.png')
```

- Main application: *identifying causal effects*
- Example: effects of improving schools on income

---
# Wide data

```{r img_wide, echo=F, out.width="90%"}
knitr::include_graphics('pics/widedata.png')
```

- Main application: *prediction*
- Example: predicting income to target ads from tons of information like location, links clicked, etc.

# Why does data type matter?

--

1. Data type determines how much memory is required to store information

2. Data type determines what method you can use to read and analyze the data

--

  - A difference-in-difference model requires a different data shape than a regression discontinuity model
  - You cannot have a wide data set with one row per unit and one column per year

---
# The data you need depend on the question you're asking

- Any dataset, no matter how big, has simplified the world in some way

- You want the simplification to match the question

- How do you record where a person is? 
  - County? Lots of people have same location. 
  - IP address? Changes frequently 
  - GPS coordinates? Too precise, and changes every second!

- Your question and theory should guide your data collection
  - Are you curious about the effect of local government policies or firms on people?
  - Are you looking to measure the effect of air pollution on health?
  - Do you want to see how people change their commute patterns over time? When there is a road closure?

# Big data & machine learning

- You'll often hear the phrase "big data and machine learning"

- This is because many machine learning algorithms are helpful for big data problems:

    - Selecting which $k<K$ covariates should enter your model

    - Streamlined techniques for processing "wild" data

    - New modeling approaches that can leverage the greater amount of information that Big Data has

# Why R and RStudio? 

### Data science positivism

- Alongside Python, R has become the *de facto* language for data science.
  - See: [*The Impressive Growth of R*](https://stackoverflow.blog/2017/10/10/impressive-growth-r/), [*The Popularity of Data Science Software*](http://r4stats.com/articles/popularity/)
- Open-source (free!) with a global user-base spanning academia and industry.
  - "Do you want to be a profit source or a cost center?"

### Bridge to applied economics and other tools

- Already has all of the statistics and econometrics support, and is amazingly adaptable as a “glue” language to other
programming languages and APIs.
- The RStudio IDE and ecosystem allow for further, seemless integration.

### Path dependency

- It's also the language that I know best.
- (Learning multiple languages is a good idea, though.)

# R code example (linear regression)

```{r fit}
fit = lm(mpg ~ wt, data = mtcars)
summary(fit)
```

---
# Base R plot

```{r mtcars_baseplot, dev="svg"}
par(mar = c(4, 4, 1, .1)) ## Just for nice plot margins on this slide deck
plot(mtcars$wt, mtcars$mpg)
abline(fit, col = "red") # Add in the object fit from before! 
```

---
# ggplot2

```{r mtcars_ggplot, dev="svg"}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data = mtcars, aes(x = wt, y = mpg)) + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", col = "red") + 
  geom_point()

# Do $\uparrow$ in GDP cause life expectancy to $\uparrow$? 

- Let's use our new-found R knowledge to try to separate correlation from causation for a critical question in economics:
  - Does increasing the economic pie (GDP) lead to longer lives (life expectancy)?

- We can use the gapminder dataset to explore this question
- The [gapminder](https://github.com/jennybc/gapminder) dataset contains panel data on life expectancy, population size, and GDP per capita for 142 countries since the 1950s
- Any predictions about what we'll learn? 

- Also, we can tap into generative AI to help us climb the steep learning curve of coding in a new language

# Install and load

Open up your laptops. For the remainder of this first lecture, we're going to play around with [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) (i.e. livecoding) to explore our question about GDP and life expectancy.

If you don't have them already, install the `ggplot2` and `gapminder` and `swirl` packages via either:
- **Console:** Enter `install.packages(c("ggplot2", "gapminder","swirl"), dependencies=T)`.
- **RStudio:** Click the "Packages" tab in the bottom-right window pane. Then click "Install" and search for these two packages.
  
![](pics/install.gif)

---
# Install and load (cont.)

Once the packages are installed, load them into your R session with the `library()` function.
```{r pkg_load}
library(ggplot2)
library(gapminder) ## We're just using this package for the gapminder data
library(swirl)
```

Notice too that you don't need quotes around the package names any more. Reason: R now recognises these packages as defined objects with given names. 

--

PS — A convenient way to combine the package installation and loading steps is with the [pacman package's](https://github.com/trinker/pacman) `p_load()` function. If you run `pacman::p_load(ggplot, gapminder)` it will first look to see whether it needs to install either package before loading them. Clever.
- We'll get to this later, but if you want to run a function from an (installed) package without loading it, you can use the `PACKAGE::package_function()` syntax.

---
# Exploratory analysis

- What initial exploratory questions do we have? Shout them out! 

--

- Here's what I want to know:

  1. How are the data organized? 
  2. What are the unique countries in the dataset?
  3. What does the relationship between GDP per capita and life expectancy look like?

- We'll tackle the third today since it is the most visually interesting

---
# Swirl installation

- Swirl is an R package that teaches you R interactively

- It's a great way to learn R if you're new to the language

- Use this code to get it up and running

```{r swirl_install,eval=FALSE}
library(swirl)
install_course_github('big-data-and-economics','ECON368-R-Swirls')
swirl()
```

- Tell swirl what it should call you (e.g. "Wizard of R")

- Then select the course `ECON368-R-Swirls` and the lesson `GGPlot Demo` (#13 last time I checked)

- Work through interactively

# Leverage ChatGPT and GitHub CoPilot

- I'm going to ask you to use a number of new technical tools in this class

- The documentation will be concise and oftentimes you won't know where to start

  - For example, how in the world are you supposed to make a ggplot plot of the gapminder data if you've never used ggplot before?
  - What if you've never even opened R? How do you even look at the gapminder data?

- I strongly encourage you to use ChatGPT and GitHub CoPilot in all aspects of this class

- ChatGPT is a large language model (LLM) developed by OpenAI

- Create an account at http://chat.openai.com/

- ChatGPT is excellent at producing basic code and helping resolve bugs

- It serves as a bridge between the abstract ideas in your head and code you write

---
# ChatGPT example

First, submit a [prompt on Mentimeter](https://www.mentimeter.com/app/presentation/bldvy2hwjfb483btveenvon9k7mbtkdm/emjehaixxc7c) 
that loads the gapminder data, displays some key checks, then makes a scatterplot of GDP per capita and life expectancy

--

**Human:**

Write an R script that does the following:

(a) Reads in the gapminder dataset using the library gapminder.

(b) Prints out the first 10 rows of the gapminder dataset.

(c) Lists which countries are in the sample (i.e. list unique values of the county variable)

(d) Plots a scatterplot of the gdpPercap by lifeExp using the gapminder dataset using ggplot. 

---
# ChatGPT example (continued)

**Assistant:**

Certainly! Here's an R script that accomplishes these tasks using the gapminder dataset:

.scroll-box-8[
```{r gapminder-chatgpt,eval=FALSE}
# Load necessary libraries
library(gapminder)
library(ggplot2)

# Step (a) - Read in the gapminder dataset
data("gapminder")
gapminder_df <- gapminder

# Step (b) - Print first 10 rows
print(head(gapminder_df, 10))

# Step (c) - List unique countries
unique_countries <- unique(gapminder_df$country)
print(unique_countries)

# Step (d) - Plot scatterplot of gdpPercap by lifeExp
ggplot(gapminder_df, aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = "GDP per Capita", y = "Life Expectancy") +
  ggtitle("Relationship between GDP per Capita and Life Expectancy")
```
]

This script assumes that the gapminder package is installed and loaded. It reads in the gapminder dataset, prints the first 10 rows, lists unique countries present in the dataset, and then creates a scatterplot of gdpPercap (GDP per Capita) against lifeExp (Life Expectancy) using ggplot2. Adjust the plot aesthetics as needed to suit your preferences.

# Tips for using ChatGPT

- Think of it as a more interactive version of Googling for the solution to a bug
  - It is not a replacement for you, the programmer
  - Think through the basic coding tasks first, then ask AI to fill in the blanks

- Be as specific as possible in your instructions
  - If you know the name of the variables in your dataset, use them

- Think of it as a more interactive version of Googling for the solution to a bug

- Try things iteratively and in small steps
  - If you're not sure how to do something, try to break it down into smaller steps
  - This is a good tip for coding in general

- Your brain is still the most powerful tool you have
  - ChatGPT is a tool to help you, not replace you
  - You will not get much mileage if you say, "Read in the gapminder dataset and do something interesting with it"

- Often it only provides "skeleton code", so you'll need to fill in the blanks

# Elements of ggplot2

[Hadley Wickham's](http://hadley.nz/) ggplot2 is one of the most popular packages in the entire R canon. 
- It also happens to be built upon some deep visualization theory: i.e. Leland Wilkinson's [*The Grammar of Graphics*](https://www.amazon.com/Grammar-Graphics-Statistics-Computing/dp/0387245448).

There's a lot to say about ggplot2's implementation of this "grammar of graphics" approach, but the three key elements are:

1. Your plot ("the visualization") is linked to your variables ("the data") through various **aesthetic mappings**.

2. Once the aesthetic mappings are defined, you can represent your data in different ways by choosing different **geoms** (i.e. "geometric objects" like points, lines or bars).

3. You build your plot in **layers**.

--

</br>

That's kind of abstract. Let's break down the elements of ggplot2 in turn with some actual plots.

- As a shortcut, we'll use AI to write the basic code for us then we'll fill in the blanks.

---
# 1. Aesthetic mappings

```{r, aesthetics0}
ggplot(data = gapminder, mapping = aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp)) + 
  geom_point()
```
---
# 1. Aesthetic mappings (cont.)

```{r aesthetics1, eval=FALSE}
ggplot(data = gapminder, mapping = aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp)) + 
  geom_point()
```

Focus on the top line, which contains the initialising `ggplot()` function call. This function accepts various arguments, including:
- Where the data come from (i.e. `data = gapminder`).
- What the aesthetic mappings are (i.e. `mapping = aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp)`).

--

The aesthetic mappings here are pretty simple: They just define an x-axis (GDP per capita) and a y-axis (life expectancy).
- To get a sense of the power and flexibility that comes with this approach, however, consider what happens if we add more aesthetics to the plot call...

---
# 1. Aesthetic mappings (cont.)

- Can you ask ChatGPT to add color the dots by continent? 

```{r aesthetics2, eval=FALSE}
ggplot(data = gapminder, mapping = aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp)) + 
  geom_point()
```

---
# 1. Aesthetic mappings (cont.)

```{r aesthetics3, dev='svg'}
ggplot(data = gapminder, aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp, size = pop, col = continent)) + 
  geom_point(alpha = 0.3) ## "alpha" controls transparency. Takes a value between 0 and 1.
```

--

- I've dropped the "mapping =" part of the ggplot call. `ggplot2` knows the order of the arguments.

---
# 1. Aesthetic mappings (cont.)

The aesthetics expect "long" data. This is distinct from the "wide" format, where each series has its own column.

--

  #### Long will work
```{r aesthetics_long,echo=FALSE}
head(gapminder)
```

#### Wide would not work

.scroll-box-12[
```{r aesthetics_wide,echo=FALSE}
gapminder %>% pivot_wider(id_cols=c(country,continent),names_from=year,values_from=c(lifeExp,gdpPercap)) 
```
]

---
# 1. Aesthetic mappings (cont.)

We can specify aesthetic mappings in the geom layer too.
```{r aesthetics4, dev='svg'}
ggplot(data = gapminder, aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp)) + ## Applicable to all geoms
  geom_point(aes(size = pop, col = continent), alpha = 0.3) ## Applicable to this geom only
```

---
# 1. Aesthetic mappings (cont.)

Oops. What went wrong here?
```{r aesthetics_mistake, warning=FALSE,dev='svg'}
ggplot(data = gapminder, aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp)) + 
  geom_point(aes(size = "big", col="black"), alpha = 0.3)
```

--

**Answer:** Aesthetics must be mapped to variables, not descriptions!

---
# 1. Aesthetic mappings (cont.)

At this point, instead of repeating the same ggplot2 call every time, it will prove convenient to define an intermediate plot object that we can re-use.

```{r p, dev='svg'}
p = ggplot(data = gapminder, aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp))
p
```

---
# 2. Geoms

Once your variable relationships have been defined by the aesthetic mappings, you can invoke and combine different geoms to generate different visualizations.

```{r geoms1, dev='svg',warning=FALSE}
p + 
  geom_point(alpha = 0.3)  +
  geom_smooth(method = "loess") # A smoothed "locally estimated scatterplot smoothing" line
```

---
# 2. Geoms (cont.)

Aesthetics can be applied differentially across geoms.

```{r geoms2, dev='svg'}
p + 
  geom_point(aes(size = pop, col = continent), alpha = 0.3)  +
  geom_smooth(method = "loess") 
```

---
# 2. Geoms (cont.)

The previous plot provides a good illustration of the power (or effect) that comes from assigning aesthetic mappings "globally" vs in the individual geom layers.
- Compare: What happens if you run the below code chunk?

```{r geoms3, eval=FALSE}
ggplot(data = gapminder, aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp, size = pop, col = continent)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.3)  +
  geom_smooth(method = "loess") 
```

---
# 2. Geoms (cont.)

The previous plot provides a good illustration of the power (or effect) that comes from assigning aesthetic mappings "globally" vs in the individual geom layers.
- Compare: What happens if you run the below code chunk?

```{r geoms3-eval, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(data = gapminder, aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp, size = pop, col = continent)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.3)  +
  geom_smooth(method = "loess") 
```

---
# 3. Build your plot in layers

We've already seen how we can chain (or "layer") consecutive plot elements using the `+` connector.
- The fact that we can create and then re-use an intermediate plot object (e.g. "p") is testament to this.

But it bears repeating: You can build out some truly impressive complexity and transformation of your visualization through this simple layering process.
- You don't have to transform your original data; ggplot2 takes care of all of that.
- For example (see next slide for figure).

- **Bonus:** Maybe this will help make sense of the non-linear relationship between GDP per capita and life expectancy?

---
# Build your plot in layers (cont.)

```{r layers1}
p2 =
  p +
  geom_point(aes(size = pop, col = continent), alpha = 0.3) +
  scale_color_brewer(name = "Continent", palette = "Set1") + ## Different colour scale
  scale_size(name = "Population", labels = scales::comma) + ## Different point (i.e. legend) scale
  scale_x_log10(labels = scales::dollar) + ## Switch to logarithmic scale on x-axis. Use dollar units.
  labs(x = "Log (GDP per capita)", y = "Life Expectancy") + ## Better axis titles
  theme_minimal() ## Try a minimal (b&w) plot theme
```

- Before executing, what will this do? 

- The comments help, as will Google and ChatGPT, but the function names are somewhat intuitive too.

---
# 3. Build your plot in layers (cont.)

```{r layers2,  echo=FALSE, dev='svg'}
p2
```

---
# What else?

We have barely scratched the surface of ggplot2's or ChatGPT's functionality... let alone talked about the entire ecosystem of packages that has been built around it. 
- Here's are an additional example to whet your appetite

--

Note that you will need to install and load some additional packages if you want to recreate the next two figures on your own machine. A quick way to do this:

```{r pacinstall, collapse=TRUE}
if (!require("pacman")) install.packages("pacman")
pacman::p_load(hrbrthemes, gganimate)
```

#### Animation! (See the next slide for the resulting GIF.)

```{r gganim1, eval=FALSE}
# library(gganimate)
ggplot(gapminder, aes(gdpPercap, lifeExp, size = pop, colour = country)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.7, show.legend = FALSE) +
  scale_colour_manual(values = country_colors) +
  scale_size(range = c(2, 12)) +
  scale_x_log10(labels = scales::dollar) +
  facet_wrap(~continent) +
  # Here comes the gganimate specific bits
  labs(title = 'Year: {frame_time}', x = 'Log (GDP per capita)', y = 'Life expectancy') +
  transition_time(year) +
  ease_aes('linear')
```

- What is different about this code? 

---
# What else? (cont.)

```{r gganim2, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(gapminder, aes(gdpPercap, lifeExp, size = pop, colour = country)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.7, show.legend = FALSE) +
  scale_colour_manual(values = country_colors) +
  scale_size(range = c(2, 12)) +
  scale_x_log10(labels = scales::dollar) +
  facet_wrap(~continent) + 
  # Here comes the gganimate specific bits
  labs(title = 'Year: {frame_time}', x = 'Log (GDP per capita)', y = 'Life expectancy') +
  transition_time(year) +
  ease_aes('linear')
```

--

Note that this animated plot provides a much more intuitive understanding of the underlying data. Just as [Hans Rosling](https://www.ted.com/talks/hans_rosling_the_best_stats_you_ve_ever_seen) intended.

---
# But do GDPPC increases cause life expectancy to increase?

- We can't answer this question with a simple plot.
- We also can't answer this question with a very fancy plot. 
- What do we need?
  > - A model
  > - A causal identification strategy
  > - More granular (bigger) data

# Some R basics

1. Everything is an object.

2. Everything has a name.

3. You do things using functions.

4. Functions come pre-written in packages (i.e. "libraries"), although you can — and should — write your own functions too.

--

</br>

Points 1. and 2. can be summarised as an [object-oriented programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming) (OOP) approach.
  - This may sound super abstract now, but we'll see *lots* of examples over the coming weeks that will make things clear.

---
# R vs Stata

If you're coming from Stata, some additional things worth emphasizing:

- Multiple objects (e.g. data frames) can exist happily in the same workspace. 
   - No more `keep`, `preserve`, `restore` hackery. (Though, props to [Stata 16](https://www.stata.com/new-in-stata/multiple-datasets-in-memory/).)
   - This is a direct consequence of the OOP approach.

- You will load packages at the start of every new R session. Make peace with this.
  - "Base" R comes with tons of useful in-built functions. It also provides all the tools necessary for you to write your own functions. 
  - However, many of R's best data science functions and tools come from external packages written by other users.

- R easily and infinitely parallelizes. For free.
  - Compare the cost of a [Stata/MP](https://www.stata.com/statamp/) license, nevermind the fact that you effectively pay per core...

- You don't need to `tsset or xtset` your data. (Although you can too.)
