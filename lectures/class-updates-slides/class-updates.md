# Class updates

  assigned on the presentations pgae

  - Class presentations will be 20 minutes long and explore a data
    science/econ topic in more depth

- Hackathon is happening

  - Hackathon will be a two-day competition in which you work in teams
    of three to solve a data science problem for the city of Lewiston
  - Jacqueline Crucet will visit the class on 9/26 to give some context
    on the problem
  - Vote on the Discussions page!

- I added my policy on posting to GitHub to the [Discussions
  page](https://github.com/orgs/big-data-and-economics/discussions/3)

  - tl;dr: Post thoughtfully

- Exercise 0 Part 0 is “due” today (basically, installation steps and
  SSH key creation)

- Exercise 0 Part 1 is due next week (bit of a catchall for demoing Git,
  RStudio, etc.)

- More exercises will be posted in the coming weeks

- Problem Set 1 will be assigned next week

- Questions on:

  - GitHub course page?
  - Syllabus and course policies? (Make note of regrading policy.)
  - Grading?
  - GitHub Education?
