# Prologue

- Most causal inference will estimate a single treatment effect and maybe a few interactions

- If an RCT shows that a financial education intervention increases earnings by 5K, does that mean everyone who experiences a 5K increase in earnings?

--

- In reality, there are many treatment effects that vary across the population

- If you know who benefits the most from a treatment, you can target the treatment to those people

- If you get it right, you're maximizing the gain from each policy dollar spent on a treatment

---
# Remember this RCT example?

- Imagine you are evaluating who to give a financial education intervention to

- An RCT shows an educational intervention increases earnings by 5K on average, that is the treatment effect $\tau$:

$$\tau = \mathbb{E}[y | \text{Treated}] - \mathbb{E}[y | \text{Control}] = \$5K$$

- Which of the following can you rule out?

  1. Every treated student experienced a 5K increase in earnings
  2. Half of treated students received a 10K increase in earnings, half experienced nothing
  3. 25\% of treated students experienced a 20K increase in earnings, 90\% experienced nothing
  4. Earnings increases uniformally distributed between 0 and 10K for the treated

Problem: we don't know exact treatment effect for each person


---
# Who do we target?

- Imagine a policymaker believes the RCT (a miracle!)

  - **Problem**: There's a limited budget to select students to receive the intervention in the future

  - **Question**: How do we select students to maximize the impact of the intervention later? 

--

- Students with high baseline scores might benefit more/less than students with low baseline scores

- Alternatively, students of color may benefit more/less than white students

- Or students from low-income families may benefit more/less than students from high-income families

- It could be a combination of all of them! Or something unobserved! 


---
# Conditional Average Treatment Effects

- The ATE is the average treatment effect for everyone in the sample

- But what if we want the ATE for a specific group?

- For example, what if we want the ATE conditional on low baseline test scores?

$$ CATE = \mathbb{E}[y | \text{Treated}, \text{Low Baseline}] - \mathbb{E}[y | \text{Control}, \text{Low Baseline}] $$

- How might we typically see how a treatment differs by a covariate? 

*Hint:* an ATE is typically just a $\beta$ in a regression -- how do we see estimate changes to $\beta$ from a new variable?

--

$$ y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_1 + \beta_2 X_2 + \beta_3 X_1 \times X_2 + \epsilon $$

- Interactions work for just a few variables, but what if we have dozens of potential interactions?

  - You quickly lose statistical power as you add more interactions
  - Also, you can quickly descending into p-hacking if you try interactions until one shows a significant effect
  - Why does p-hacking lead to bad policy?

--

- There are bound to be spurious correlations in any dataset

---
# Causal Forests and CATEs

- Causal forests provide a way to estimate a CATE as a function of covariates without having to specify interactions

- Basically, it maps a person to a CATE based on their observable characteristics

- This is a very powerful tool for policy

- It is also really tricky to implement correctly

- And it often does not work as well in practice as it does in theory

# Decision Tree Review

---
# What is a decision tree? 

--

- A decision tree organizes variables into tree like structure
  - It is essentially, a really fancy flowchart

- At each node, pick the variable that best meets a decision rule

- At node 1, the algorithm cycles through each $X$ variable and finds the split in the data that best meets the decision rule
  - It picks the best $X$ variable
  - It follows the branch down and creates nodes by looking at the remaining $X$'s that best meet the decision rule

- When making a decision about an observation, follow the tree down the branches

---
# Types of decision trees 

### Regression trees

- The decision rule is what variable $X$ best predicts $y$ when split at some cutoff point $\bar{X}$
  - Typically the predicted $\hat{y}$ is the average of $y$ conditional on $X$ being less than or greater than $\bar{X}$
  - Alternatively, it could be the mode

- At the terminal node, the prediction $\hat{y}$ is the average of $y$ for all observations in that node

- The decision rule is whatever split minimizes the sum of squared errors (SSE) between the predicted $\hat{y}$ and the actual $y$

### Causal Trees 

- Instead of splitting based on prediction of $y$, split to maximize the difference in the average treatment effect (ATE) between the two branches

- At each node, the $X$ covariate that maximizes the difference in the ATE is selected

- Why?

- The goal is to see how varied the treatment effect is across different subgroups of the population
  - This is the heterogeneity of treatment effect (HTE)
  - We want to find the subgroups that have the largest HTE

- The result gives a conditional average treatment effect (CATE) for each subgroup from a variety of $X$'s

### Lots of others, don't worry about them

# Random Forests

---
# Many trees make a forest

- Decision trees are fairly easily to interpret once you make one

- But one drawback is that they are very sensitive to the data

  - Too many nodes and you could overfit
  - Too few nodes and you'll just have noise

- So what if we made many trees and averaged the predictions?
  - Technically this is just called "bagging" (bootstrap aggregating)
  - Random forests also randomize the variables available to split the nodes
  - See more at [Introduction to Statistical Learning, Chapter 8.2](https://www.statlearning.com/)

- But won't we just repeat the same tree over and over?
  
---
# Pull yourself up by your bootstraps

- How could we use bootstrapping?

--

- If you bootstrap the data $B$ times, you create $B$ new samples of the data indexed $b$

1. For each bootstrap sample $b$, create a decision tree $T_b$ using the bootstrap sample $b$ 
2. For each observation $i$ in the original sample, predict the outcome $y_i$ using all $B$ trees
3. Average the predictions as $\hat{y}_i = \frac{1}{B} \sum_{b=1}^B T_b(X_i)$

- This is called bagging (bootstrap aggregating)

- **Intuition**: With many trees, you can average out the noise and get a better prediction

- Random forests add a twist to bagging by randomly selecting a subset of $X$ variables to split the nodes in the tree
  - This ensures the trees are uncorrelated with each other
  - Minimizes variance

**Intuition**: By randomizing the $X$ variables available to a tree, they are less likely to only use the same variables to split the nodes in the tree. As a result, the algorithm evaluates other variables in the data.

# Use cases of random forests

- Random forests are a very popular machine learning technique

- They are used for prediction, classification, and causal inference

- Kleinberg et al. (2018) use random forests to predict the judicial bail decisions in NYC

# Causal Forests

# Causal Forests

- Causal forests are a type of random forest that estimate the conditional average treatment effect (CATE) for each observation

- Causal forests are just a bunch of causal trees
  - Each node in the tree maximizes the difference in the ATE between the two branches
  - The result is a tree-specific CATE for each observation

- The average of the tree-specific CATEs is the CATE for each observation

### Limitations of causal forests

- Causal forests cannot resolve the fundamental problem of causal inference: unobserved confounders

- Causal forests .hi[cannot, will not, and never] will be able to create a causal effect where not exists

---
# Separate Causal Trees

- A single causal tree is created by finding the cutoff in each variable that maximizes the treatment effect variance across groups

- What is "treatment effect variance across groups"?
  - Roughly it corresponds to the difference in ATE between the two groups
  - There are different ways to write this out, but they should discount any variation in the treatment effects within the groups

- The result is a tree-specific CATE for each observation

---
# Honest Causal Forests

- One issue that can arise is if you use the **same** sample to split the data as you use to estimate the treatment effects in a sample

- Why? This leads to issues with the standard errors. 

- **Intuition**: Once you split the data based on the treatment effects, any estimated treatment effects are no longer truly random. 
  - In general, you never want to use input data to an algorithm to evaluate its performance

- "Honest causal forests" provide a workaround 

- Split the data to make a causal tree in a "splitting sample" and "estimation sample"

  1. The "splitting sample" is used to pick the splitting variables/cutoffs
  2. The "estimation sample" is grouped based on the splitting rules, then the treatment effects are calculated

- The goal is to maintain the randomness that generated the treatment assignment, while using the same groups

---
# Causal Forest algorithm

Here is an algorithm for causal forests taken from [Davis and Heller (2016)](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.p20171000)

  1. Draw subsample $b$ without replacement of $n_b < N$ observations from the original sample of size $N$.

  2. Randomly split the $n_b$ observations to form a training sample $tr$ and an estimation sample $e$ so $n_tr = n_e =\frac{n_b}{2}$. 

  3. For each value of each $X_j = x$, form candidate splits of the training sample into two groups based on whether $X_j \leq x$. 
    - Choose the split that maximizes treatment effect variance across the two subgroups. 
    - If the split increases variance relative to no split, split. If no split increases the variance, this is a terminal node.

  4. Once no more splits possible, group the $n_e$ observations in this tree based on $X$s.

  5. With the estimation sample, calculate $\tau^l = y _T - y_C$ within each terminal node. (Makes it honest!)

  6. In full sample, assign $\tau^l_b = \tau^l$ to each observation whose $X$s would place it in node $l$. Save $\tau^l_b$.

  7. Repeat steps 1-6 $B$ times to create $B$ trees

  8. Define each i's CATE as $\tau^i_{CF}(x) = \frac{1}{B} \sum_{b=1}^b \tau^l_b$, the average prediction for that individual across trees.

# Financial education in Brazil

- [Bruhn et al. (2016)](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/app.20150149) evaluate the effect of a financial education intervention on student achievement in Brazil
  - 892 (~25K students) schools across six states were randomly assigned to treatment or control
  - Treatment: three semesters of financial education during 11th and 12th grade by trained students with free textbooks
  - Sub-treatment: Parental workshop on financial education

- Average treatment effect that student financial proficiency increased by 7% initially, dropping to 5% in second follow-up

# Causal forests and Bruhn et al. (2016)

- The makers of the R package **grf** for generalized random forest, create a [tutorial](https://grf-labs.github.io/grf/articles/grf_guide.html#application-school-program-evaluation-1) of how to use causal forests to estimate the conditional average treatment effects in [Bruhn et al. (2016)](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/app.20150149)

- Find CATE vary a decent amount across different variables

- Specifically, those with lower financial autonomy benefited more than average from the program

- The application then shows how to use the package **policytree** to estimate the optimal policy implementation

# Ranked Average Treatment Effect (RATE)

- Once the CATE is known, you can start seeing how the treatment effect varies across the population

- Specifically, you can rank the population by their CATE and then calculate the CATE on a separate sample
  - "Train sample" to train the forest
  - "Test sample" to predict the CATE
  - "Evaluation sample" to see how well the CATE predicts the treatment effect

- Alternatively, you can do the same thing, but rank instead by a covariate of interest (e.g. financial autonomy) that seems to drive the CATE differences
