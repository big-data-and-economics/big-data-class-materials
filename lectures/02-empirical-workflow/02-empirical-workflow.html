# Jargon

- There is a jargon in this class that won't make sense at first, I'll try to flag it as it comes

- Here's a few terms:

.hi[Local machine:] Your personal (or any) computer that isn't a server accessed via the internet

.hi[Version Control:] Keep track of different iterations of a project/code

.hi[Repository:] The location on GitHub of all project files and (commented) file revision history

.hi[GUI:] A Graphical User Interface -- what you're used to pointing and clicking to navigate a computer and execute programs

.hi[Command line:] Removes the "graphical" from GUI, instead you type all commands to navigate a computer and execute programs

  - R operates via the Command line, RStudio is a GUI
  - On Mac, this is called Terminal which uses Bash (Linux) commands
  - If you installed Git for Windows, you got *Git Bash*, which uses Bash (Linux) commands
  - You can also install Windows Subsystem for Linux to run Linux on a Windows machine

.hi[Script:] A file that contains code that can be executed by a computer, i.e. `.R`, `.Rmd`, `.do`, `.py`, etc.

# Reducing empirical chaos

## Sad story

- Once upon a time there was a boy who was writing a job market paper on unemployment insurance during the pandemic

- This boy presented the findings a half dozen times, spoke to the media some, and generally thought he had cool results

- Several people suggested he look at a handful of other outcome series and try changing his analysis unit frequency from monthly to weekly

- He also knew that he needed to restrict his sample to reduce noise

---
# The horror!

- But then after making these changes and re-running his code that took two days, his new sample dropped by 50 percent!
- He was, understandably, terrified.
- The young boy spent a week looking for the fix weeding through six different versions of the .do, .R, .dta, .csv, .sh, .py files with suffixes like *_v1* and *_test* and *_test2* and *_final_I_swear* and *_okay_i_lied*
- Finally he discovered the phrase:

```r
df %&gt;% filter(insample_new==0)
```
**instead of**

```r
df %&gt;% filter(insample_new==1)
```
- The boy was very frustrated and decided to work on these slides while re-running his code.

- Today and next class are about minimizing these struggles through Clean Code and a reproducible workflow

# Clean Code

---
# What is Clean Code?

.hi[Clean Code:] Code that is easy to understand, easy to modify, and hence easy to debug

--

#### Clean code advances scientific progress

- Good science uses careful observations to iteratively test hypotheses/make predictions

- Scientific progress is impeded if

    - mistaken previous results are erroneously given authority
    - previous hypothesis tests are not reproducible
    - previous methods and results are not transparent

- Thus, for science that involves computer code, clean code is a must

- Reduces "the influence of hidden researcher decisions" (Huntington-Klein et al. 2021)

--

#### Clean code increases personal/team sanity

- You will always make a mistake while coding -- what makes good programmers great is their ability to identify and correct mistakes 

- Clean code makes it easier to identify and correct mistakes

- Saves you stress in the long-run and makes your collaborative relationships more pleasant

---
# Why clean code is under-produced

- If clean code is so beneficial and important, why isn't there more of it?

--

1. .hi[Competitive pressure] to produce research/products as quickly as possible

2. .hi[End user] (journal editor, reviewer, reader, dean) .hi[doesn't care what the code looks like], just that the product works

3. In the moment, clean code .hi[takes longer to produce] while seemingly conferring no benefit

---
# How does one produce clean code?

1. Organization of data and files

2. Version Control&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;

3. Automation

4. Abstraction

5. Documentation

6. Time / task management

7. Test-driven development (unit testing, profiling, refactoring)

8. Pair programming

.footnote[&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; Handle in Git lecture notes.]

name: organization
# 1a. File organization

1. Separate directories by function

2. Separate files into inputs and outputs

3. Make directories portable

- To see how professionals do this, check out the source code for R's [dplyr](https://github.com/tidyverse/dplyr) package

    - There are separate directories for source code (`/src`), documentation (`/man`), code tests (`/test`), data (`/data`), examples (`/vignettes`), and more

- When you use version control, it forces you to make directories portable (otherwise a collaborator will not be able to run your code)

    - Use __relative__ file paths, not absolute file paths

---

# What is a working directory?

- All the files on your computer are organized in directories or folders

- When you are running a script, you are working from a particular directory
  - This is *not necessarily* the directory where the script is located
  - Your computer looks for `my_data.csv` in this directory when you execute `read.csv('my_data.csv')`
  - If that file is not in that directory, you will get a `FileNotFound` error
  - In **R**, you can see what directory you are in using the `getwd()` function
    - It is also above the console in RStudio
    - You can change your working directory using the `setwd()` function (avoid this within scripts)
    - Alternatively, you can double click the `.Rproj` file to set the working directory to the root of the project


```r
getwd()
## [1] "C:/Users/kgcsp/OneDrive/Documents/Education/Big Data/big-data-class-materials/lectures/02-empirical-workflow"
#setwd('lectures/02-empirical-workflow')
```

---
# What is a directory path?

A path defines the location of a file or directory in a file system tree. If I navigate to this file in my computer, it is: 

`C:\Users\kgcsp\OneDrive\Documents\Education\ECON368-DSE\big-data-class-materials\lectures\02-empirical-workflow\02-empirical-workflow.Rmd`&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;

The name separates folders that chart the path from the .hi[root] to the file
  - .hi[root]: the start of the file system tree (above that is `C:\`)
  - Each folder along the tree is separated by a `\` or `/`

This is called an .hi[absolute path]:
  - It is long, hard to remember, and not portable across computers

.hi[Relative paths] solve a lot of this:
  - The path to a file or directory starting from the current working directory
  - If my working directory is `/big-data-class-materials`, then I can write `lectures/02-empirical-workflow/02-empirical-workflow.Rmd`
  - **This is portable** -- if I send this script to you and you have a copy of the `big-data-class-materials` repository, this script will work

.footnote[&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; This is a Windows path, Mac and Linux paths use `/` instead of `\`.]

---
# How I organize research projects

- Entire projects should *ideally* live within the same directory
- I have a folder called (`my_project`)
  - Within that folder I have subfolders:
      1. `data` for all data files
          a. `raw` for raw data files
          b. `clean` or `work` for cleaned data files
          c. `temp` for temporary data files
      2. `code` for all code files, and sometimes:
          a. `code/analysis` for code files that build/clean code
          a. `code/build` for code files that do analysis
      3. `output` for all output files
          a. `output/figures` for code files that make figures
          b. `output/tables` for code files that make tables
      4. `literature` or `articles` for all relevant literature
      5. `writing` for all writing files
          a. `writing/notes` for notes
          b. `writing/drafts` for drafts
          c. `writing/edits` for edits
      6. `presentations` for all presentations
          a. `presentations/slides` for slides
          b. `presentations/notes` for notes
- I'll further more or less as needed
- See GitHub folder for this lecture as an example

# What is the value of directories?

- All of the files in a directory are related to each other
- Can reference a file within the `data/raw` folder, from the `code/build` folder without writing out the full path

### Help! I am in code/, but I need data/raw/file.csv!

- You can use relative paths to navigate between directories
- `..` means "go up one directory"
  - `../data/raw` means "go up one directory, then down into `data/raw`"
- `.` means "stay in the current directory"
  - `./code/build` means "stay in the current directory, then down into `code/build`"
- `../..` means "go up two directories"
  - `../../data/raw` means "go up two directories, then down into `data/raw`

Play around with them yourself!

---

# 1b. Data organization

- The key idea is to practice .hi[relational data base management]

- A relational database consists of many smaller data sets

- Each data set is tabular and has a unique, non-missing key

- Data sets "relate" to each other based on these keys

- You can implement these practices in any modern statistical analysis software (R, Stata, SAS, Python, Julia, SQL, ...)

- Gentzkow &amp; Shapiro recommend not merging data sets until as far into your code pipeline as possible

name: automation
# 3. Automation

- Gentzkow &amp; Shapiro's two rules for automation:

1. Automate everything that can be automated

2. Write a single script that executes all code from beginning to end

- There are two reasons automation is so important

    - Reproducibility (helps with debugging and revisions)

    - Efficiency (having a code base saves you time in the future)

---
# How to write scripts

### Keep them modular
- Each script should do one thing and one thing only
- e.g. It takes an input in, it returns an output

    - Taking in a raw file and returning a cleaned version
    - Taking in two files and merging them
    - Taking in a cleaned file and returning a figure

### Have a main script that runs all scripts in order

- A single script that shows the sequence of steps, i.e. "shows your work"
  - This script will run modular scripts in sequence to exactly reproduce your analysis

- You will rarely run it all at once, but it will be a nice way to organize your thoughts

- A benefit of a well-organized directory: easily see what scripts you need to run in what order

- In R, use `source('rscript.R')` to run a script from one script

- A main script could be a `.Rmd`, a `.R`, a `.sh`, a `.py`, a `.do` etc.

name: main-script
# Main script 


``` r
#File: main.Rmd or main.R
#By: Kyle Coombs
#What: Runs the project from start to finish in Python
#Date: 2024-09-09

# Instructions:
# Run this code from the root directory of your project where the housekeeping file, build, and analysis files are located

#Install packages with housekeeping. Also put together paths.
source('housekeeping.R')
#User written functions can be sourced -- or you could write a package, your call
source(paste0(build,'clean_functions.R'))
source(paste0(analysis,'analysis_functions.R'))

#Import files
source(paste0(build,'import_census.R'))
source(paste0(build,'import_admin_data.R'))

#Clean files
source(paste0(build,'clean_census.R'))
source(paste0(build,'clean_admin_data.R'))

#Merge files 1 to 2
source(paste0(build,'merge_census_admin.R'))

#Analysis
source(paste0(analysis,'/summary_stats.R'))
source(paste0(analysis,'/basic_regression.R'))

#Tables will likely be made with a host of R packages
source(paste0(analysis,'/make_sum_figures.R'))
source(paste0(analysis,'/make_reg_figures.R'))
source(paste0(analysis,'/make_sum_tables.R'))
source(paste0(analysis,'/make_reg_tables.R'))
```

[Main script with functions](main-with-functions)

---
# Main script as .Rmd

- In this class, your problem sets will be .Rmd files that you knit

- The `.Rmd` file will serve as your main script

- You can `source()` modular code files in code chunks

- It improves chances your code runs from start to finish instead of only when you are working interactively
  - Means I can run your code more easily! 

---
# What's a housekeeping file?

A housekeeping file .hi[automates] several tasks and goes at the start of every file in your project

1. Load packages
2. Save strings of path directories to use later using the `file.path()` function to reference elsewhere&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;
  - If a folder name changes, you only need to change it in one place in your code
  - Use these strings to reference files in other scripts `read.csv(file.path(data_raw,'my_data.csv'))`
3. Create directories if they don't exist

.footnote[&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; Alternatives to `file.path()` include `paste` and `here()`. Check [appendix example](#here) for more information.]

name: abstraction
# 4. Abstraction

- What is abstraction? "reducing the complexity of something by hiding unnecessary details from the user"

- e.g. A dishwasher. All I need to know is how to put dirty dishes into the machine, and which button to press. I don't need to understand how the electrical wiring or plumbing work.

- In programming, abstraction is usually handled with functions

- Abstraction is usually a good thing

- But it can be taken to a harmful extreme: overly abstract code can be "impenetrable" which makes it difficult to modify or debug

---

# Rules for Abstraction

- Gentzkow &amp; Shapiro give three rules for abstraction:

1. Abstract to eliminate redundancy

2. Abstract to improve clarity

3. Otherwise, don't abstract

- In the context of R, abstraction means:
  - Write functions
  - Name your objects sensibly

---

# Abstract to eliminate redundancy

- Sometimes you might find yourself repeating lines of code to accomplish a task


```r
# Downloading a sequence of files from 2004 to 2020 gets tedious
download.file('https://data.nber.org/tax-stats/zipcode/2020/zipcode2020.zip',destfile=paste0(data_dir,'zipcode2020.zip',sep='/'))
download.file('https://data.nber.org/tax-stats/zipcode/2019/zipcode2019.zip',destfile=paste0(data_dir,'zipcode2019.zip',sep='/'))
download.file('https://data.nber.org/tax-stats/zipcode/2019/zipcode2019.zip',destfile=paste0(data_dir,'zipcode2018.zip',sep='/'))
# etc.
```

Notice any problems?


``` r
# Downloading a sequence of files from 20 wih a loop
lapply(2004:2020,function(y) {
    download.file(paste0('https://data.nber.org/tax-stats/zipcode/',y,'/zipcode',y,'.zip'),destfile=paste0(data_dir,'zipcode',y,'.zip',sep='/'))
})
```

- We'll learn more about iteration/for loops/appy statements later

- There are many forms of redundancy that can be eliminated with abstraction beyond iteration

---
# Abstract to improve clarity

Say you want to round a number to the nearest of different integers: 

1. Divide the number by there base integer
2. Round the result to the nearest whole number
3. Multiply by the base integer

I start coding and copy and paste the code for each integer:


``` r
rounded_157_nearest_5 &lt;- round(157/5)*5
rounded_157_nearest_7 &lt;- round(157/5)*7
```

--

Notice a problem? 

--

Why not abstract with a function?


``` r
round_to_nearest &lt;- function(x,base=5) {
    return(round(x/base)*base)
}

rounded_157_nearest_5 &lt;- round_to_nearest(157,base=5)
rounded_157_nearest_7 &lt;- round_to_nearest(157,base=7)
```

The second approach is easier to read and understand what the code is doing!

---

# Otherwise, don't abstract

1. Write/use functions for tasks that are repeated
2. Write thoughtful variable names (e.g. `x100, x101` versus `household_income`, `household_size`)

- If we're only doing it once in our script, then it may not make sense to use the function version

- This discussion points out that it can be difficult to know if one has reached the optimal level of abstraction

- As you're starting out programming, I would advise doing almost everything inside of a function (i.e. err on the side of over-abstraction when starting out)
  - And look for opportunities to loop (or use apply functions)

---
name: documentation
# 5. Documentation

1. Don't write documentation you will not maintain

2. Code should be self-documenting

- Generally speaking, commented code is helpful

- However, sometimes it can be harmful if, e.g. code comments contain dynamic information

- It may not be helpful to have to rewrite comments every time you change the code

- Code can be "self-documenting" by leveraging abstraction: name your functions and variables thoughtfully

---
# A README is documentation 

- A README gives high-level information about the repository or data file:
  - This repository contains code that does X task
  - Simple use case: use this repository to replicate paper X in journal Y

- Onboarding instructions:
  - Add your name to this file in repository folder `the/folder/file.md`
  - Fork the repository and pull request changes
  - Configure your computer settings in this way to run this project
  - Guidelines/rules for contributing to the project

- Licensing information:
  - You can just take this code!
  - This is proprietary and we will sue you if you haven't paid us

- Dependencies:
  - To use this code or package or data_dir download packages `X`, `Y`, `Z`

- Changelog (short narrative commit history):
  - 9/23/2023 - KGC - added function `X` to do `Y`

---

# Documentation in R

- .hi[R Help System:] access using `?function_name`

- .hi[Package vignettes:] access using `vignette("vignette_name")`

- .hi[Cheatsheets:] access at [Posit Cheatsheets](https://posit.co/resources/cheatsheets/)

---
name: time-task
# 6a. Time management

- Time management is key to writing clean code&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;

- It is foolish to think that one can write clean code in a strained mental state

- Code written when you are groggy, overly anxious, or distracted will come back to bite you

- Schedule long blocks of time (1.5 hours - 3 hours) to work on coding where you eliminate distractions (email, social media, etc.)

- Stop coding when you feel that your focus or energy is dissipating

.footnote[&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; Your professor needs this lecture too]

---

# 6b. Task management

- When collaborating on code, it is essential to not use email or Slack threads to discuss coding tasks

- Rather, use a task management system that has dedicated messages for a particular point of discussion (bug in the code, feature to develop, etc.)

- I use GitHub issues and milestones for all of my coding projects including [developing this class](https://github.com/orgs/big-data-and-economics/projects/2)

- For my personal task management, I use GitHub Projects

---
name: test-driven
# 7. Test-driven development

- The only way to know that your code works is to test it!

- Test-driven development (TDD) consists of a suite of tools for writing code that can be automatically tested

- Simplest test is to check if the code gives you the output you expected
  - Whenever you make a change, check it against the output you expect
  - Ideally, check against a small example so it runs fast and is easy to confirm

- What if the code takes too long to check completely? Meet .hi[unit tests]

- .hi[Unit testing] is nearly universally used in professional software development

---
# Unit testing

- Unit tests are scripts that check that a piece of code does everything it is supposed to do

- When professionals write code, they also write unit tests for that code at the same time

- If code doesn't pass tests, then bugs are caught immediately

- R's [dplyr package](https://github.com/tidyverse/dplyr) shows that all unit tests are passing and that tests cover 91% of the code base

- [testthat](https://testthat.r-lib.org/) is a nice step-by-step guide for doing this in R (I use it to autograde exercises)

### Assertions

- Assert statements are extremely useful for basic unit tests
- They exist in every langage
- In R it is called stopifnot()


```r
x &lt;- TRUE
stopifnot(x)

y &lt;- FALSE
stopifnot(y)
```

```
## Error: y is not TRUE
```

---
name: mre
# Minimal reproducible example

- Related to unit testing are minimal reproducible examples (aka MRE, reprex, minreps,...)

- The best way to isolate bugs is a minimal reproducible example

- If your code throws an error message, there's likely a ton of superfluous stuff in your code that is not causing the error
  - But the superfluous stuff makes it harder to read!

- [Minimal reproducible examples](https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example) (reprex) are a great way to isolate the error
    - .hi[Minimal]:: Use as little code as possible that still produces the same problem
    - .hi[Complete]:: Provide all parts needed to reproduce your problem in the question itself
    - .hi[Reproducible]:: Test the code you'll provide to make sure it reproduces the problem

- That means you should be able to copy and paste the code and run it yourself
    - Name all packages and data needed to reproduce error
    - Cut out irrelevant packages, steps, and data that are not relevant to the error

- Sometimes writing one will help you find the bug, sometimes it'll help a stranger find the bug in your code faster, and sometimes it'll identify a very real bug in the package itself

---

# Min Reprex from [RStudio community](https://community.rstudio.com/t/faq-how-to-do-a-minimal-reproducible-example-reprex-for-beginners/23061)

- If someone does not have `hrbrthemes` installed, they will not be able to run the code below
  - You can remove this package from your code and still reproduce the error.


```r
library(ggplot2) #For ggplot
library(datasets) #To load irs
library(hrbrthemes) #For the theme
data(iris)
df &lt;- iris %&gt;%
    mutate(Sepal.Length = Sepal.Length * 1000,
           Sepal.Width = Sepal.Width * 1000)

ggplot(data = df,x = Sepal.Length, y = Sepal.Width) +
    theme_modern_rc() +
    geom_point() +
    scale_x_log10() +
    labs(title = "Iris Sepal Width vs. Sepal Length",
         subtitle = "Log10 Scaled X Axis")
```

```

# A great MRE
.scroll-output[
#### Summary 
When I try to make a scatterplot with ggplot, I am told that `geom_point()` requires missing aesthetics `x` and `y`. But I specified `x` and `y` in the `ggplot()` function. Can you help resolve?

#### Expected behavior 

I expected the code to produce a scatterplot of `Sepal.Length` and `Sepal.Width` from the iris dataset.

#### Data

I used a subset of the iris dataset.


``` r
dat &lt;- iris[1:4,]
```

#### Code and error message

``` r
ggplot(data = dat, x = Sepal.Length, y = Sepal.Width) +
    geom_point()
```

# Troubleshooting tips

- Sometimes you've made several changes to your code and suddenly it stops running
    - Was it the new `if` statement?
    - That sick new vectorized function to replace the `for` loop?
    - A stray typo?

- How do you find the bug in hundreds of lines of code? 

- Read your code to see if there is an obvious mistake

- .hi[Binary search]: Comment&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; half your code, run the script, and see if the bug persists
  - If it does, the bug is in the other half
  - If it doesn't, the bug is in the commented half
  - Repeat on each half until you narrow to set of lines
  - If you can solve the bug from that line, great! 

- If all else fails, make a .hi[Minimal reproducible example]!

.footnote[&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; Comment in R with `#`. Comment in RMarkdown with `&lt;!-- code --&gt;`. Or highlight and press `Ctrl+Shift+C` in RStudio.]

# Troubleshooting tips (cont.)

- Step back and ask if you're solving the right problem
  - e.g. I'm trying to make a plot, but I'm getting an error about a missing variable. Maybe I should check if I'm loading the right data
  - e.g. I have to create a long data set and I have annual files, but my code is merging instead of appending...

- Check for superfluous things you can remove
  - e.g. Wait, I don't need to include absolute file paths, I can use relative paths

- Try small fixes, then apply broadly
  - e.g. I think the problem is with how I wrote my file paths, let me try to get just one file path to work

- Change one thing at a time
  - e.g. The problem is either with my `paste0()` statement or the `ggsave` function, let me try to get the `paste0()` statement to work first

---
# Troubleshooting tips (cont.)

- Embrace GitHub committing
  - When you have code that works, stage, commit and push it -- even if it is only a small piece of the puzzle
  - If it breaks, [revert](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/managing-commits/reverting-a-commit-in-github-desktop)
  - This minimizes how much you need to re-do/keep track of

- Sometimes it is easier to change how you write something
  - e.g. Rmarkdown doesn't like the character `#` in filepaths, but I can change the filepaths rather than trying to force Rmarkdown to accept it

- There's more than one way to skin a cat
  - e.g. If I can't get `read.csv()` to work, I'll try `read.table()`
  - e.g. This `googlesheets4` package doesn't seem to work -- what about `gsheet` or `googledrive`?

- With ChatGPT or Google, make very specific asks
  - e.g. "How do I get a file named `/my/path/name/my_file.pdf` to appear when I knit `other/folder/name/file.Rmd`?"

---

# 8. Pair programming - work with a buddy

- An essential part of clean code is reviewing code

- An excellent way to review code is to do so at the time of writing

- .hi[Pair programming] involves sitting two programmers at one computer

- One programmer does the writing while the other reviews

- This is a great way to spot silly typos and other issues that would extend development time

- It's also a great way to quickly refactor code at the start

- .hi[I strongly encourage you to do pair programming on problem sets in this course!]
    - (Sometimes I will require it)

# Try to write an MRE!

- Sync your fork of the exercise repository and open the folder for [mre-exercise](https://github.com/big-data-and-economics/exercises/blob/main/mre-exercise)

# Learn by Immersion

- Just like learning a real language, no amount of talking today will teach you how to use any program.
  - You have to need to use it (immersion) to learn it.
  - Google is your dictionary.
  - Help files are your grammar books.
  - ChatGPT is your phrasebook.
  - A great way to start coding is to see lots of other people's code and copy what you read.

- You must learn how to ask the “right” question:
  - Never: "Importing csv file into R not working."
  - Better: "read_csv R [specific error message]."
  - Better still: "read_csv tidyverse [specific error message]."

# Note on seeds

- When randomizing in any language, you aren't really randomizing

- You're producing pseudo-random numbers that return in a deterministic ordered list

- If you set the seed, you can reproduce the same "random" numbers

- This is useful for debugging and sharing code

- Use `set.seed` in R


```r
set.seed(0)
print(rnorm(1)+rnorm(1,5)+rnorm(1,10))
## [1] 17.26652
print(rnorm(1)+rnorm(1,5)+rnorm(1,10))
## [1] 15.14712
# New seed
set.seed(1)
print(rnorm(1)+rnorm(1,5)+rnorm(1,10))
## [1] 13.72156
print(rnorm(1)+rnorm(1,5)+rnorm(1,10))
## [1] 16.10432
# Reset seed
set.seed(0)
print(rnorm(1)+rnorm(1,5)+rnorm(1,10))
## [1] 17.26652
print(rnorm(1)+rnorm(1,5)+rnorm(1,10))
## [1] 15.14712
```

# Make your own documentation

- R has excellent built-in documentation called `Roxygen2`

- These make great documents above functions to increase readability

- Here's an example:


```r
library(roxygen2)
#' This is a sample function
#'
#' This function does something amazing.
#'
#' @param x A numeric input.
#' @return The result of the amazing operation.
#' @examples
#' amazing_function(5)
amazing_function &lt;- function(x) {
  # function implementation
}
```

- Use `roxygen::roxygenise()` to generate documentation for all functions in a file
- Read more [here](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/roxygen2/vignettes/roxygen2.html)

---
name: refactor
# Refactoring

- Refactoring refers to the action of restructuring code without changing its external behavior or functionality. Think of it as "reorganizing"

.scroll-box-8[

``` r
get_some_data &lt;- function(config, outfile) {
  if (config_ok(config)) {
    if (can_write(outfile)) {
      if (can_open_network_connection(config)) {
        data &lt;- parse_something_from_network()
        if(makes_sense(data)) {
          data &lt;- beautify(data)
          write_it(data_dir outfile)
          return(TRUE)
        } else {
          return(FALSE)
        }
      } else {
        stop("Can't access network")
      }
    } else {
      ## uhm. What was this else for again?
    }
  } else {
    ## maybe, some bad news about ... the config?
  }
}
```
]
after refactoring becomes
.scroll-box-8[

``` r
get_some_data &lt;- function(config, outfile) {
  if (config_bad(config)) {
    stop("Bad config")
  }

  if (!can_write(outfile)) {
    stop("Can't write outfile")
  }

  if (!can_open_network_connection(config)) {
    stop("Can't access network")
  }

  data &lt;- parse_something_from_network()
  if(!makes_sense(data)) {
    return(FALSE)
  }

  data &lt;- beautify(data)
  write_it(data_dir outfile)
  TRUE
}
```
]
- Nothing changed in the code except the number of characters in the function

- The new version may run faster, is more readable. The output is unchanged.

- Refactoring could also mean reducing the number of input arguments

- Jenny Bryan gave a [great talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oyiPBjLAWY) on refactoring

name: profiling
# Profiling

- Profiling refers to checking the resource demands of your code


- How much processing time does your script take? How much memory?


- Clean code should be highly performant: it uses minimal computational resources


- Profiling and refactoring go hand in hand, along with unit testing, to ensure that code is maximally optimized


- Here are two intro guides to profiling in R:
  - Using `system.time` and `Rprofs` from R Programming for Data Science[https://bookdown.org/rdpeng/rprogdatascience/profiling-r-code.html]
  - Using `lineprof` from Advanced R[http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Profiling.html]

# Neat R functions to help reduce redundancy


```r
set.seed(16)
list1 = list() # Make an empty list to save output in
for (i in 1:3) { # Indicate number of iterations with "i"
    list1[[i]] = multiply(i) # Save output in list for each iteration
}
list1
```

```
## [[1]]
## [1] 1.547257
## 
## [[2]]
## [1] 11.934479 -1.717951
## 
## [[3]]
## [1] -7.4831177  0.9587218  4.7882622
```

A better way to eliminate this redundancy is to use the `map` function:


```r
set.seed(16)
map(1:3, multiply)
```

```
## [[1]]
## [1] 1.547257
## 
## [[2]]
## [1] 11.934479 -1.717951
## 
## [[3]]
## [1] -7.4831177  0.9587218  4.7882622
```

# Alternative to file.path is `here()`

- Better yet is the [here](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/here/vignettes/here.html)
    - `here()` will find the root directory of your project and then you can navigate from there


```r
#install.packages('here')
library(here)
```

```
## here() starts at C:/Users/kgcsp/OneDrive/Documents/Education/Big Data/big-data-class-materials
```

```r
here::i_am('my_project/code/build/.placeholder')
```

```
## here() starts at C:/Users/kgcsp/OneDrive/Documents/Education/Big Data/big-data-class-materials/lectures/02-empirical-workflow
```


```r
here('data/raw','my_data.csv')
```

```
## [1] "C:/Users/kgcsp/OneDrive/Documents/Education/Big Data/big-data-class-materials/lectures/02-empirical-workflow/data/raw/my_data.csv"
```

- Can be less clunky than `paste()` and `sep="/"`

- Get lost in your directories? Use `file.path()` to identify your root directory

&lt;!-- Now if I need to adjust the `constructor()` function, I only have to modify one line of code instead of three. This approach also minimizes typos in copy-pasting lines that are largely similar. --&gt;
