# Prologue

- We've covered a lot of ground this semester

- Today we'll wrap up text analysis and machine learning
  - There's a lot left uncovered
  - There's a lot that is insufficiently covered

- We'll cover some intuition and applications
  - Climate change perceptions and text analysis
  - Gendered language in anonymous economics forums (using analysis by an undergraduate!)

- I'll offer some closing thoughts on what you should do with all this knowledge

# Intuition: Machine Learning and Text Data

- Text data usually starts fairly unstructured and messy

- Last class we covered how you clean it up

- Today we'll cover how you can use it to learn about the world

- We'll "cover" two uses
  - Sentiment analysis
  - Topics modeling

- Then we'll talk about some applications

---
name: bag-of-words
# Bag of words

- How do we know if a text is about a certain topic?

- One way is to look at the words it contains

- For example, is the following about finance?

  - "Stocks are doing well today."

- You know because it mentions the stock market

- This is the bag of words approach
  - If it mentions a word related to a topic it's about that topic
---
# Drawback of bag of words

- We miss a bunch of context

- Is this sentence about the economy?
  - "I place great stock in my friends."

- Not really, but it contains the word stock

- This is not to say that bag of words is useless
  - It's a good starting point
  - It's easy to implement
  - It's easy to understand

- You just need to be aware of its limitations and whether they matter for your application

---
name: sentiment-analysis
# Sentiment analysis

- Sentiment analysis is often a bag of words approach to classifying text
  - The simplest form is just searching for words that are related to positive or negative sentiment
  - Can you think of some words that are related to positive or negative sentiment?

- If you read the following sentences, which one is happy? 
  - "I love economics."
  - "I hate big data."
  - "If Professor Coombs can get a PhD, anyone can."
  - "I'm so happy I could cry."

- This can get ambiguous fast, no? (And I didn't spend along on these examples.)

# Sentiment Analysis lexicons

- Sentiment analysis lexicons are lists of words that are related to positive or negative sentiment"
  - [AFINN lexicon](http://corpustext.com/reference/sentiment_afinn.html)
  - [Bing lexicon](https://emilhvitfeldt.github.io/textdata/reference/lexicon_bing.html)
  - [NRC lexicon](https://saifmohammad.com/WebPages/NRC-Emotion-Lexicon.htm)

- If you find those words in a text, you can classify it as positive or negative

- Let's try one

---
# Sentiment Analysis lexicons

The package **tidytext** has the function `get_sentiments()` to get sentiment lexicons, which downloads them from the internet
  - **textdata** is where you get afinn
  - What's different about these?

```{r get_sentiments}
get_sentiments("afinn") %>%
  rename(afinn_value=value) %>%
  full_join(get_sentiments("bing"), by="word") %>%
  full_join(get_sentiments("nrc"), by="word",suffix = c('_bing','_nrc')) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(afinn_value), !is.na(sentiment_bing), !is.na(sentiment_bing))
```

---
# Jane Austen package

- The `janeaustenr` package contains the full text of Jane Austen's novels

- Let's use it to classify the sentiment of her novels

```{r tidy_jane}
tidy_books <- austen_books() %>%
  group_by(book) %>%
  mutate(
    linenumber = row_number(),
    chapter = cumsum(str_detect(text, 
                                regex("^chapter [\\divxlc]", 
                                      ignore_case = TRUE)))) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  unnest_tokens(word, text)
tidy_books
```

---
# NRC sentiment analysis

- Only keep positve words

```{r nrc_sentiment}
nrc_joy <- get_sentiments("nrc") %>% 
  filter(sentiment == "joy")

tidy_books %>%
  filter(book == "Emma") %>%
  inner_join(nrc_joy) %>%
  count(word, sort = TRUE)
```

---
# Measuring net sentiment by line

```{r track-it}
jane_austen_sentiment <- tidy_books %>%
  inner_join(get_sentiments("bing")) %>%
  count(book, index = linenumber %/% 80, sentiment) %>% # Divide evey 80 lines of text
  pivot_wider(names_from = sentiment, values_from = n, values_fill = 0) %>% 
  mutate(sentiment = positive - negative)

ggplot(jane_austen_sentiment, aes(index, sentiment, fill = book)) +
  geom_col(show.legend = FALSE) +
  facet_wrap(~book, ncol = 2, scales = "free_x")
```

---
# Which words are most common?

```{r common-words,echo=FALSE}
tidy_books %>%
  inner_join(get_sentiments("bing")) %>%
  count(word, sentiment, sort = TRUE) %>%
  ungroup() %>% 
  group_by(sentiment) %>%
  slice_max(n, n = 10) %>% 
  ungroup() %>%
  mutate(word = reorder(word, n)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(n, word, fill = sentiment)) +
  geom_col(show.legend = FALSE) +
  facet_wrap(~sentiment, scales = "free_y") +
  labs(x = "Contribution to sentiment",
       y = NULL)
```

---
# How would ML come in handy?

- Well above we just took the lexicons as given

- But what if we went through half the Jane Austen books (or books by her peers) and marked off sentences as positive or negative?

- Then we could feed each line to a machine learning algorithm and have it learn what words are positive or negative
  - We could even have it learn what combinations of words are positive or negative
  - And train it on one book, test it on others
  - Train it on another, test on the others, etc.

- Potential algorithms: Lasso, Naive Bayes, Random Forest, Neural Networks, etc.

- Then we could use that to classify the sentiment of the other half of the books

- This is a very common use of machine learning called .hi[supervised learning] because we fed it trained data

# Applications

Many applications of machine learning of text are relevant for economics

1. Measure perceptions of climate change/economic conditions

2. What are the political leanings of a newspaper? Political speech? 

3. Are there biases against certain groups in language used in a form of media? 

4. And many, many, many more

# Climate change and perceptions

- These next few slides are adapted from slides by [Raj Chetty and Gregory Bruich](https://opportunityinsights.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Lecture-15-environment-2.pdf)

- You're likely aware that the Earth is getting warmer

- Have you heard the metaphor about the frog in the pot of water?
  - If you put a frog in a pot of boiling water, it will jump out
  - But if you put a frog in a pot of cold water and slowly heat it up, it will stay in the pot until it dies

- Are we the frog?

- Moore et al. (2019) hypothesize that the gradual pace of climate change has made it less salient

- This might explain why people are not more concerned about climate change given the evidence of how it will change our way of life/lead to major economic/social costs

- They look at tweets to see how often people discuss the climate, how they discuss it, and how that has changed over time/location with temperature

---
# Measuring Perceptions of Climate Change: Methods

- Data: 2.2 billion geocoded Tweets from 2014-16 and local area temperature
measurements from 1981-2016

- Goal: estimate a model that relates frequency of weather related tweets to
temperature anomalies

- "Bag of words" classification algorithm: define a tweet as weather-related if it
contains any word in a list of pre-defined weather related terms

- Validation: sample 6,000 tweets and manually define them as weather-related
or not to evaluate accuracy of classification of algorithm

# Check-in

- Can anyone think of potential ways this could miss tweets?

- Would it pick up tweets we don't want?

- Any words missing?

- Weird words? 

---
# True positives

- it's too hot to be dressin cute
- I swear when it comes to driving in the rain, people in Southern California are
idiots on the road
- Thinking of another day full of rain makes me cringe
- It's pretty warm
- Its so hot dawg
- I want want to go swimming! Its too hot out here!!
- I cold af
- Hot as f**k
- Something about a rainy day so cozy
- I am so mad about this snow outside omg..
- the weather is nuts!- 

---
# False positives

- I need an ice cold Bud Light. @budlight
- In so tired of never being able to go out to dinner because everything is jam
packed due to the Heat game. every year. Same bs.
- "The cold never bothered me anyway." This movie never gets old
- me- he looks familiar. ash- he is familiar he's hot
- I live for all of the intense parts of songs by Arctic Monkeys.
- 1st degree burns from making hot coco. Hurts like hell
- dad never failed to buy the ocean breeze
- I wish I could freeze moments to be able to appreciate them more. Things are
so fleeting

# Measuring Perceptions of Climate Change: Methods

- Data: 2.2 billion geocoded Tweets from 2014-16 and local area temperature
measurements from 1981-2016

- Goal: estimate a model that relates frequency of weather related tweets to
temperature anomalies

- "Bag of words" classification algorithm: define a tweet as weather-related if it
contains any word in a list of pre-defined weather related terms

- Validation: sample 6,000 tweets and manually define them as weather-related
or not to evaluate accuracy of classification of algorithm
  - 46% of tweets classified as “weather-related” are false positives
  - But frequency of errors is uncorrelated with temperature fluctuations, so unbiased
estimates of link between weather and climate perceptions despite error

# Dynamic Adjustment Model 

- Next, relate tweets in a given week to rate of temperature anomalies both in that
week and to frequency of similar anomalies in previous years

- Dynamic adjustment model: captures how a sequence of anomalies (i.e., hotter
temperatures over time) affect perceptions

# Concluding thoughts on class

- Big data tools are powerful

- They're complicated too

- Start small and build up

- If you don't know how to do something, solve a simpler problem first

- Document, document, document (comments are great!)

- Abstract complicated tasks into language you understand

- Use version control when trying new things
